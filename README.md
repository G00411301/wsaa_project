# Web Services and applications module big project

This github repository contains all of the files for my submission for the big project for the web services and applications module in ATU.

The project (Type A) involved writing a flask server that would allow CRUD operations on a database via an API. The project is a contacts book that allows users to access the contacts book online and carry out basic funcitions such as create, read, update and deleting contacts from the underlying SQL data base.
